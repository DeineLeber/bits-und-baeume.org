	<p>
	After four years of waiting and many online conferences (perhaps too many) <a href="https://blog.fiff.de/chaos-communication-camp/">the Chaos Communication Camp is back!</a> Join us from <strong>August 15th to 19th</strong>. The <a href="https://bits-und-baeume.org/">Bits &amp; B√§ume movement</a> invites you to participate in the <strong>Bits-&amp;-B√§ume-Habitat</strong>.</p><p>As a village, we cover topics at the intersection of sustainability and digitalization, ranging from interconnected mobility and resource and energy consumption to data sufficiency, cooperative platform economies, sociopolitical emancipatory movements, decentralized networks, as well as issues of monopolization in the digital sphere. 
Together, we are searching for solutions for a sustainable world that respects both nature and human rights. Let's rethink our world and boost our resilience.
Do you have insights, thoughts, and experiences to share? Do you know about sustainable technology use and provision, such as hacking or improving old devices, using solar or wind energy, or decentralized and community-based sustainable software and hardware projects for our future? 
We are looking for inspiring talks, hands-on workshops, community/developer/strategy meetings, or any other public, informative, or collaborative activities. Therefore we will provide a stage and a workshop area.

	Together we are looking for <a href="https://bits-und-baeume.org/en/conference-2022/demands/">answers and ways</a> <strong>toward a sustainable society</strong> respecting both our livelihood and nature, as well as freedom, democracy, and human rights.</p><p>Let us rethink our world, implement our utopias, unite our forces, and strengthen our resilience. Do you have knowledge, insights, criticism, perspectives, thoughts, and practical experiences that you would like to present and share with others? Are you familiar with, using, or creatively building sustainable digital technology, working on the reuse of old devices, utilizing solar energy or wind power, or involved in decentralized and community-based software and hardware projects for our sustainable future? Or do you provide technical support to progressive protest groups?

If so, you are in the right place: We are looking for inspiring lectures, practical workshops, community/developer/strategy meetings, or other public, informative, or collaborative activities. We provide a stage and a workshop area for this purpose.
	</p>
	<p>
	As the climate crisis is affecting people in the global south the most, we would especially encourage those individuals to share their ideas for a resilient technical world. We are looking forward to your proposals. We would like to actively encourage FLINTA* and Queer* people, BIPOC, and people from the global south to apply.
