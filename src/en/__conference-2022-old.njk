			Since the successful first Bits & Bäume conference in 2018, the topics of digitalisation and sustainability have become more relevant for our society today than ever before. We are facing major social and global challenges for creating a just and sustainable world. That is why we are organising the Bits & Bäume 2022 conference, taking place from 30 September to 2 October 2022. The conference will enable environmental and social justice activists, technology experts and human rights defenders to expand and deepen their networking. This also includes the networking between our communities and representatives of small socio-ecologically responsible digital companies as well as politicians in order to find concrete solutions for the most pressing questions of our time. We want to discuss major political strategies and concrete governance proposals, but also learn from each other through best practice examples of  how to achieve climate and environmental protection, social justice, democracy and fundamental rights in the digital age.


        </p>

			There is a kick-off event planned on the evening of 30 September 2022. On 1 and 2 October 2022 we have a diverse and exciting conference programme in store for you.
